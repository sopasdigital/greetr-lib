# Greetr Library

This is my attempt at creating the Greetr library exercise from the Udemy course Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts by Anthony Alicea. I've adapted parts of library to suit my coding style. I intend to refactor this as I learn more things about ES6 and beyond.

## Overview

This library basically creates greeting formats that you can use on your site. It's quite barebones right now, but I plan on expanding this during my down time. If you have any suggestions as to how we can improve this Greetr library, please don't hesitate to either do pull requests, or send me inquiries or suggestions.

### Prerequisites

This library can be used so long as JavaScript is enabled. This also has basic integration with jQuery if you wish.
